Be clear and concise.
Use simple language and avoid jargon unless absolutely necessary.
Provide examples.
Include a license to avoid confusion about project use and contribution rights.
Example Structure:

## Table of Contents
- [Introduction](#introduction)
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Contributing](#contributing)
- [License](#license)

## Introduction
This project does X, designed to solve Y.

## Installation
1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the application: `python main.py`

## Usage
See below for example usage:

(Continue with similar sections and syntax as outlined above.)

Remember: The README should provide all the information a new user would need to understand and use your project. Always revisit and update the README as your project evolves.
